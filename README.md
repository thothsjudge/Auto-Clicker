Description for ClankMaster!

I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH USE AT YOURE OWN RISK!!  

I DO NOT CLAIM THIS TO BE 100% UNDETECTABLE THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE TO BE DETECTED/BANNED NOTHING IS 100% UNDETECTABLE!!!

ClankMaster is an auto-clicker tool that simulates mouse clicks between two locations with customizable settings to adjust to how the user want's things to run.

The default values are based on 1000s of online searches and personal configurations through Trial&Error therefore it should be MOSTLY undetectable in plenty of games as it has been as Humanized as possible.





Q/A

Is There a Virus or Trojan?

No explicit malware detected. (Scanned with Bitdefender, Norton 360, ESET NOD32, Malwarebytes, McAfee, Trend Micro and Analyzed by Chat GPT PRO)
No network requests (i.e., it doesn't send data to a remote server).
No keylogging (even though "keyboard" is imported).
No file manipulation (beyond exporting logs to users pc).

However, Microsoft Defender may flag it as a "HackTool" or "Trojan" because:

It automates clicks and movements, which can be used for malicious purposes.
It binds hotkeys, a common tactic in malware.
It runs continuously in the background and hides in the system tray, which might look suspicious.
